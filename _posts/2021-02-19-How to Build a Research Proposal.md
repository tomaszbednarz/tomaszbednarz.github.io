Many of us write funding proposals on daily basis - whether they are for research, or industry projects, they all require innovative ideas, and need to convince assessors and sponsors about impact or return of investment to support the proposal.

However, to make an idea a reality, first step is to have a communication plan, either in form of pitch, grant proposal, or a story. This is not a trivial task, and requires lots of thinking and brain storming.

How to convince others about big rewards your idea can generate? Write it down. 

# The Heilmeier Catechism

A former director of DARPA, George H. Heileier formulated [a set of questions](https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/heilmeier-catechism) helping to evaluate ideas and evaluate proposals. I found those questions very useful in research environments, whether you're writing a research proposal or grant funding application. 

* What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
* How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
* What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
* Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?
* What are the risks?
* How much will it cost?
* How long will it take?
* What are the mid-term and final “exams” to check for success?
